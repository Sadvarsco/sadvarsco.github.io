# sadvarsco.github.io Made because I was quite confused which heroes were available for picking.
Quick Simple Metamadness selection screen to help see who is and isnt available for hero selection. 
How does it work. 
The first 20 heroes selected will be considered 'Pre-banned'. Those heroes will then be grayed out.
Every Hero selected after the 'Pre-banned' should be conisdered "In-Game heroes picks" for the match. They will turn Red and be unselectable.

Hitting the "Hide Banned/Picked" Button will move all "Pre-banned" and "In-Game Hero picks" to the bottom of the list.
Hitting reset will basically refresh the page back to a default.

NOTE: The Heroes are mostly in alphabetical order (mostly grouped by letter). Cho and Gall are currently considered 2 separate Heroes.

Any updates/corrections/suggestions, leave me a comment.
