Quick Simple Metamadness selection screen to help remember who is and isnt available for hero selection.
Made because I was quite confused which heroes were available for picking.

How does it work.
The first 20 heroes selected will be considered 'Pre-banned'. Those heroes will then be grayed out and no longer selectable
